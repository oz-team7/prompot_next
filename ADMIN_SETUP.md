# Admin Setup Guide

## Current Status
The admin functionality is implemented and ready to use with the account:
- Email: prompot7@gmail.com
- Password: prompot0820^^

## Features Implemented
1. **Prompt Management**: View, search, edit, and delete prompts
2. **System Management**: Settings, announcements, and backup management (UI ready)
3. **User Detail View**: View user details, statistics, and block/unblock users
4. **Report Management**: View and process user reports with approval/rejection workflow
5. **Real-time Dashboard**: Auto-refresh feature for live statistics updates (30-second interval)
6. **Activity Logs**: View all admin activities with filtering by action type

## Database Setup (Required)
To enable full admin functionality with proper permissions and logging, execute the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/tlytjitkokavfhwzedml/editor
2. Copy and execute the content from:
   - `supabase/migrations/003_admin_tables.sql` (Admin tables and permissions)
   - `supabase/migrations/004_reports_table.sql` (Reports management)

This will create:
- `admin_users` table for managing admin permissions
- `admin_logs` table for tracking admin activities
- `system_announcements` table for announcements
- `system_settings` table for system configuration
- `system_backups` table for backup management
- Proper RLS policies for security

## Current Implementation
Currently, admin access is granted by checking if the user's email is 'prompot7@gmail.com'. Once you execute the migration, the system will use the `admin_users` table for proper permission management.

## After Migration
Run the following script to properly set up admin permissions:
```bash
node scripts/setup-admin.js
```

This will add prompot7@gmail.com as a super admin with full permissions.
